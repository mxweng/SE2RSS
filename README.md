# A-combinatorial-algorithm-for-saturated-extended-2-regular-simple-stacks
This repository is used to store codes of the paper "A combinatorial algorithm for saturated extended 2 regular simple stacks".

The worksheet "code.mw" contains Maple source codes to simplify the expressions of LO(n,k), LO_k(n), ELO(n,k), and ELO_k(n), and also to calculate the values of ELO(n,k).
